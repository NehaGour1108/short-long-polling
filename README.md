Implement Short Polling and Long Polling Mock,Define API that client can do to short poll the status,Define API that client can do to long poll the status


In the context of polling, the server sends data as a response to the client when the client makes a request. Here's how it works:

### 1. **Server's Role in Polling:**

- **For Short Polling:**
  - The client sends a request (usually every few seconds) to the server to check if there is new data or status.
  - The server immediately responds to the request with the latest available data (even if it hasn't changed).
  - The response is typically in a format such as JSON, and the client then processes the response.

- **For Long Polling:**
  - The client sends a request to the server, but instead of responding immediately, the server holds onto the request until new data becomes available or after a specific timeout.
  - Once the data is available or the timeout occurs, the server sends the response to the client.
  - After the client receives the response, it immediately sends another request to the server to wait for new data.

### 2. **Where Does the Server Send the Data?**

- The server sends the data **back to the client** as an HTTP response. 
- The data is returned to the client’s browser as a **response to the client’s request**.
- In the case of polling, the client and server are communicating over HTTP, and the data is sent in the body of the HTTP response.

### 3. **How It Works (Code Example):**

Let's walk through both **short polling** and **long polling**:

#### 1. **Short Polling**

In short polling, the client sends a request to the server at regular intervals. The server responds immediately with the current data.

In this example:
- When the client sends a GET request to `/status`, the server immediately responds with the current timestamp.
- The client, on its side (e.g., `short-polling.html`), will periodically (every 5 seconds, for instance) call this endpoint and receive the latest status.
- The server sends the current time in JSON format.

**Client-side code** (`short-polling.html`):


#### 2. **Long Polling**

In long polling, the client sends a request to the server, but the server holds the request open until it has data to respond with (or a timeout occurs).

In this example:
- When the client sends a GET request to `/status`, the server will hold the request for 10 seconds (simulating waiting for new data).
- After 10 seconds, the server responds with the current timestamp.
- The client, on its side, will immediately send another request to `/status` once it receives a response.

**Client-side code** (`long-polling.html`):

### 4. **Where the Data Goes:**

- The **client** makes an HTTP request (GET) to the server, which has an endpoint (e.g., `/status`).
- The **server** processes the request, determines if there's new data, and sends a response back to the client.
- The **client** receives the response, processes it (e.g., logging the status, updating the UI), and if necessary, repeats the request.

### 5. **How to See the Messages Sent by the Server:**

- **In the browser’s developer tools (Network Tab)**: 
  - If you open the developer tools (press F12 or right-click > Inspect) in your browser and go to the **Network** tab, you can see each request made to the server and the responses sent back.
  - For short polling, you’ll see the requests coming in at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 seconds).
  - For long polling, you'll see a request held open for a while before it responds.
  
- **In the browser console**:
  - The client-side JavaScript (`console.log(data.status)`) will print the received data to the browser's console, so you can directly see the server’s responses there.
  
### 6. **Conclusion:**
The **server sends data back to the client** when the client makes a request, whether through short polling (immediate response) or long polling (response after a delay). The data is typically in JSON format, and the client processes the response as needed.
